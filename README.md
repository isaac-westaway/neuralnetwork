A simple feedforward application which creates a neural network structure and passes every x and y value (normalized) within a specified range through, and colours the pixel accordingly.

Will implement backpropogation to "learn" of a decision boundary

facts:

uses cross-entropy loss function

uses softmax

### learning credits:

this stanford lecture note: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/7.pdf, and the chapter 5 one about regressions, i cant find it anymore, it was a good starting point
