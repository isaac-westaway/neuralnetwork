A simple feedforward application which creates a neural network structure and passes every x and y value (normalized) within a specified range through, and colours the pixel accordingly.

Will implement non-linear activation
Will implement backpropogation to "learn" of a decision boundary

facts:

uses cross-entropy loss function

uses softmax
